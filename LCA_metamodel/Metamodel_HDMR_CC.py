 Metamodel_HDMR.py, translated by @author: kkuriyan, 01-10-2018 from Metamodel_HDMR.m 

 This is a HDMR file. It has been built with inputs normalized to [0, 1] range and matched to the desired/computed ouput 
 So it reads in inputs in [0, 1] and calculates the appropriate output 

 x_in      : is of size "nxN" where n=number of inputs, N=number of
             samples
 varargin  : can be empty = [] (currently not used by the code)
 y_out     : should be of size "m1xm2xN" where m1=number of outputs,
             m2=number of time steps, N=number of samples
 varargout : is set varargout{1}=m1 and varargout{2}=m2
